== Description

ThinPHP is a simple and elegant, but powerful framework for PHP
It is based on VorticePHP (http://github.com/caferrari/vorticephp), but intent to be more "thin", simpler and does not have some features that I think are not needed.

== KISS

Yeah, it's based on the KISS principle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), and because of that, this project is and always is gonna be small.

== Features

* MVC (Model, View, Controller)
* Routes (rewrite URL) (Based on Regular Expressions)
* Template engine (Master pages)
* Encrypted sessions and cookies
* Capable of connect on many data sources

== Requisites

Any webserver with rewrite module, PHP 5.2+ and git to checkout the project. if you have that, just go to your webroot folder and do:

  git clone git://github.com/luanlmd/thinphp.git

== Installing on Debian/Ubuntu + Apache2

You need the apache2 webserver, git and php5 installed to use:

  sudo aptitude install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 git-core php5-mysql
  sudo a2enmod rewrite

then you need to edit the AllowOverride setting in <tt>/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default</tt>

  sudo pico /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

now change the AllowOverride in <tt>/var/www</tt> directory from NONE to ALL:

  <Directory /var/www/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
  </Directory>

restart the apache2 webserver and clone the project:

  sudo apache2ctl restart
  cd /var/www
  git clone git://github.com/luanlmd/thinphp.git

now it should be working, access http://localhost/thinphp
